### 🔧 **Project Title: Temperature Monitoring Systm 

### 🧾 **Objective:**

To design a system using a temperature sensor that reads and displays real-time temperature data on an **LCD** or **Serial Monitor**.

---

### 🔌 **Components Required:**

* Arduino UNO (or any microcontroller)
* LM35 or DHT11 Temperature Sensor
* 16x2 LCD Display (or use Serial Monitor)
* Resistors, Breadboard, and Jumper Wires
* USB Cable for programming

---

### 🔁 **Circuit Design:**

**If using LM35:**

* **VCC** to 5V on Arduino
* **OUT** to A0 on Arduino
* **GND** to GND on Arduino
